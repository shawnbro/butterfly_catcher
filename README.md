## A Fun Game to Catch & Learn About Butterflies

### Overview:
- Butterfly Catcher is a game in which a player uses the keyboard arrows to float a net around an enclosed area to catch butterflies as they roam around.  If the net makes contact with a butterfly, the butterfly gets added to the player's 'jar', and points accumulate.  Each butterfly has a name, a description, and a point value (based on the butterfly's rarity).  The game becomes more difficult as it progresses.  Play to find out how.

### Infrastructure/Libraries:
  
  - Ruby/Rails for back-end routing/controllers
  - MongoDB to create/update/manage games & butterflies
  - Javascript/jQuery/Backbone.js for interactivity between front & back-ends
  - Phaser Game Library for actual game play, loading sprites, physics, & enabling user interaction
  
### The Process:
- This application was conceived and mostly built in a one-week long 'sprint', conceived to mimic the Agile development process.  Most of the models & behavior are tested and there is a list of user stories at <a href=''>this Pivotal tracker page</a>.
